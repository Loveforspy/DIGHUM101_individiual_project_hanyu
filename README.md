# Individual Project: The Most Frequently Used Words In Queenâ€™ s Songs

**Student Name: Hanyu Fu**

## Description:
   This is a file for the final individual project of DIGHUM101, UCBerkeley summer session. <br>
   In this project, I collected lyrics of Queen's music. I mainly used spaCy, pandas, and seaborn to process my data. <br>
   The aim of this project is to find out the most frequent words of their songs. Also, to find out the main themes of their songs.<br>
   Based on the data I collected, I got the most frequent 30 words of their music, and the top 2 words were "get" and "love".<br>
   Through those 30 words, I think the main themes of their music were love, and to encourage people to strive during their lifetime, which met my expectation.<br>
   I appreciate the chance for me to work on this project. Thank you so much for seeing this repository. <br>
