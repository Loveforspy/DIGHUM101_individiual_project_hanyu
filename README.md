## Description:
   This is a file for the final individual project of DIGHUM101, UCBerkeley summer session. 
   In this project, I collected lyrics of Queen's music. I mainly used spaCy, pandas, and seaborn to process my data. 
   The aim of this project is to find out the most frequent words of their songs. Also, to find out the main themes of their songs.
   Based on the data I collected, I got the most frequent 30 words of their music, and the top 2 words were "get" and "love".
   Through those 30 words, I think the main themes of their music were love, and to encourage people to strive during their lifetime, which met my expectation.
   I appreciate the chance for me to work on this project. Thank you so much for seeing this repository.
